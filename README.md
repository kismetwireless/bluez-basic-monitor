# BLUEZ-BASIC-MONITOR

An extraction of the bluez dbus monitoring code simplified to perform signal and device monitoring only, intended as a simple base for inclusion in other tools.

The majority of this code is from the bluez-5.46 project (and is noted as such in the comments and directories); the bulk of the heavy lifting is done by the dbus interface.
